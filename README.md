# DSCI 553: Foundations and Applications of Data Mining

## University of Southern California

### Overview
This repository contains my coursework and projects for DSCI 553, a comprehensive data mining course taught by Professor Wei-Min Shen. The course focuses on the algorithms and techniques used for analyzing massive datasets, with an emphasis on system building using Apache Spark.

### Course Objectives
- Understand the fundamental algorithms of data mining and machine learning for large-scale data analysis.
- Gain practical experience with big data technologies, particularly Spark.
- Develop skills in designing and implementing scalable systems for real-world data mining problems.


### Key Topics Covered
1. **Introduction to Data Mining and MapReduce**
2. **Large-Scale File Systems and Big Data Technologies**
3. **Frequent Itemsets and Association Rules**
4. **Mining of Massive Datasets including Streaming Data**
5. **Recommendation Systems and Collaborative Filtering**
6. **Analysis of Massive Graphs and Social Networks**
7. **Link Analysis and Web Advertising**
8. **Advanced Topics in Clustering and Classification**

### Assignments
This section includes details about the six homework assignments and the final project, which involved building an advanced recommendation system. Each assignment reinforced concepts covered in lectures and readings, and they were implemented using PySpark.

### Final Project
A detailed description of the final project including objectives, implementation details, and outcomes. Highlight the use of Spark and other technologies to build a recommendation system that competes on accuracy.

### Technologies Used
- **Apache Spark**: Utilized for large-scale data processing.
- **Python**: Primary programming language for implementing data mining algorithms.
- **Scala**: Additional implementations to complement PySpark scripts.

### How to Use This Repository
Instructions on how to set up and run the projects locally, including installation of necessary software and libraries.
